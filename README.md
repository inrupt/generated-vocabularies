files will be available soon.

# Installation and testing

## Prerequisites

In order to install and test these artifacts, you will need:
- Node v12 or higher.

## Build and run

The following example demonstrates the usage of `@inrupt/lit-generated-vocab-common`.
It can be adapted to the other artifacts available in the repository by changing
the directory and picking a term from a vocabulary bundled in the target artifact.

```bash
cd lit-generated-vocab-common/TypeScript
npm install
npm run build
```

To test the generated artifact, place the following code in the folder where you
just ran the `build` command, e.g. in a `test.js` file:

```javascript
const { AS } = require("./dist/index");
console.log(`The english label for the term ${AS.Activity.value} is ${AS.Activity.label.value}.`);
```

Running `node test.js` should print `The english label for the term https://www.w3.org/ns/activitystreams#Activity is Activity.`
